You can use pyAudioDspTools to start learning about audio dsp because all relevant operations are in plain sight,
no C or C++ code will be called and nearly no blackboxing takes place. You can also easily modify all available audio
effects and start writing your own, you only need to know python and numpy as well as audio dsp basics. As this package 
is released under the MIT licence, you can use it as you see fit. If you want to examine the code, just open the
'pyAudioDspTools' folder in this Git and you can see all the relevant modules.
